   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Background
==========

 When I started looking at using available online information for renewable projects I was surprised at just how hard it was to access. This package is the evolution of those attempts. It aims to provide a simple way to access and then use the information and as such is constantly evolving.

 All of the sources referenced are freely available, though some have (*unclear*) restrictions on using the data. I have tried to include warnings in the documentation when this is the case.

 My documentation skills are still weak, so there may well be errors in these documents - please let me know and I'll try to fix them!

Python 3 Support
================

 I am aiming to make the package fully Python 3 compatible, but my initial focus is Python 2.7 as that is the version that it will be immediately used with.

 At the present time, support is partial and many things will not work as expected.

ToDo List
=========

 There are many improvements that the :mod:`pywind` package could benefit from, but these are the ones currently on my radar!

 - increase coverage of pywind command line app prior to releasing a 1.0.0
 - standardise the way the modules are used and data is accessed
 - improve documentation
 - add travisCI integration
 - improve test coverage

Patches Welcome!
================

 I'm always keen to improve the package, so if you have suggestions, comments, patches or even better pull requests - send them along!
