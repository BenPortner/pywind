ToDo List
=========

There are many improvements that the :mod:`pywind` package could benefit from, but these are the ones currently on my radar!

- increase coverage of pywind command line app prior to releasing a 1.0.0
- standardise the way the modules are used and data is accessed
- standardise how data is saved across modules and add support to command line functions
- improve logging abilities to allow for a named file to be used
- improve documentation
- add travisCI integration

Patches Welcome!
================

I'm always keen to improve the package, so if you have suggestions, comments, patches or even better pull requests - send them along!
